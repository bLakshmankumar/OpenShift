# Create deployement in OpenShift :
# =================================
  > Go to Openshuft Ui
  > Go to your project 
  > Click on Application tab (We can see one deployment we can see that automatically created when an application was added to the project the first time)
     In previous we created a new build configuration that generates a Docker Image of our application.

# In this demo we will create a Deployment configuration to deploy the docker image on the Openshift cluster.
=============================================================================================================
 While working with the UI, If you need an additional information on any topic, Choose learnmore link it'll redirect to the official doc of OpenShift.
  Here is the official doc : https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_online/3/html/developer_guide/deployments#cr
> If you go to abive url, 
> Here we can see a template configuration file, That can be used to create a new deployment configuration.
> Copy that yaml & paste it in your vsc, and update the names and image name and tag (which we created previously).
  Note : you can see the available images under builds > imgaes tab on open shift UI under your project.

> And update the triggers as well inside the yaml, The triggers make sure the application is redployed every time a change is made to my Docker image tagged by the image stream.
  For example when the build job runs and updates my Docker image as a result of a code change. 
> Once the file ready head back to the OpenShift UI, To create a new deployment configuration.
> Go to your project
> Inside the project 
> Choose Applications 
> Choose Add to project on top right corner
> In drop down choose the Import Yaml/Json
> Paste the content of the file we just created above and click on create.

Now you can see a new deployment configuration inside deployments, Check the state(active or pending).
> click on the deployment button on top right side, it's a manually triggers a new deployment.
> If you want to automate the deployment, Then do some changes is repo level, And it'll trigger a new build and update the image and start a new deployment.

Note : So far we haven't done any configuration to access the application externally, We need to configure services and routes for that, and that is what we will look at next.
