# How/Process to deploy a sample app into OpenShift step-by-step :
# ================================================================
 Goal:
âœ… Push simple Python app into OpenShift
âœ… Build it using OpenShift BuildConfig
âœ… Deploy it as a pod
âœ… Expose it using OpenShift Route (make it public)

Step 1: Prepare a very simple app :
-----------------------------------
Suppose you have this file structure:
/sample-python-app
  â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
  â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt

#app.py:
#-------

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello OpenShift World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)

# requirements.txt:
# -----------------
  Flask

# Step 2: Login to OpenShift :
------------------------------
oc login https://<your-openshift-cluster-url> --token=<your-token>
Now you're authenticated.

# Step 3: Create a new OpenShift project :
------------------------------------------
Think of a project like a namespace
oc new-project my-sample-app

# Step 4: Push the code to GitHub :
-----------------------------------
You should push the app to a GitHub repo like:
https://github.com/your-user/sample-python-app 
Because OpenShift will pull the source code from Git!

# Step 5: Create a BuildConfig to build your app :
--------------------------------------------------
Tell OpenShift:
  where to pull code
  what builder image to use
  where to store the built image
Command: 
oc new-app python:3.10-ubi8~https://github.com/your-user/sample-python-app.git --name=hello-openshift
  ðŸ‘‰ What this does:
     It pulls code from GitHub
     It uses a Python 3.10 base image
     It builds a container image
     It saves it into OpenShift internal registry
     It creates a deployment automatically

# Step 6: Expose your app to the world :
----------------------------------------
Create a Route (like a LoadBalancer or Ingress): 
   oc expose service hello-openshift
Now check the route: 
   oc get route
It will show you a URL like:
   http://hello-openshift-my-sample-app.apps.cluster.example.com
âœ… Open it in browser â€” you will see:
        Hello OpenShift World!

# Full Flow Visual:
-------------------
You Push Code â†’ GitHub
        â†“
oc new-app â†’ OpenShift builds container image
        â†“
oc expose service â†’ OpenShift creates public URL
        â†“
Browser â†’ App Live!

# In just 5 minutes, you:
=========================
   Built an image from source code
   Deployed your app
   Exposed it to public
   All managed securely by OpenShift
