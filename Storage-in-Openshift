# What is storage in openshift ?
================================
  > In OpenShift (just like Kubernetes), storage refers to persistent storage that is attached to your containers/pods.
  > Containers are ephemeral by default â€” if a pod dies, its filesystem is wiped out.
  > Storage solves this by providing Persistent Volumes (PVs) that survive pod restarts, rescheduling, or failures.
  > OpenShift manages storage with Kubernetes primitives:
  > PersistentVolume (PV): Actual storage resource (physical or cloud disk).
  > PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC): A request by a pod for storage.
# Why Do We Need Storage? (What Problems It Solves) :
=====================================================
               Problem Without Storage	                                                       How Storage Solves It
     Container files are lost when pod restarts.	                             Persistent storage preserves data across restarts.
 Stateful apps (like databases) cannot survive failures.	                  Persistent Volumes store DB data safely outside of the pod.
    Hard to manage storage manually for each app.         	              StorageClasses + PVC automate and simplify storage provisioning.
      No way to do backups or snapshots easily.	                                  Storage providers support snapshotting volumes.
Need to scale across multiple storage types (fast, slow, file, block).	      StorageClasses let you define multiple storage backends.
